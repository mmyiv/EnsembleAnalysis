# Working with Ensemble Data

This repository contains tutorials illustrating the differences between "ensemble members" - simulations run with identical model physics and external forcing, differing only in their initial conditions.

Contents are as follows:

1. Plotting Multiple Ensemble Members.ipynb: Shows some basic techniques for reading in multiple ensemble members from a single model using the CMIP6 AWS catalog, storing in xarray, and plotting the ensemble mean and ensemble spread on a time series.

2. Plotting Regional Time Series Using Shapefiles.ipynb: Does similar tasks as tutorial 1, but with the capacity for selecting a region of interest using a shape file rather than a simple lat/lon range.

3. Ensemble Spread and Statistical Significance.ipynb: Gives some additional practice at locating ensembles of various sizes, as well as constructing probability distribution functions for regionally averaged time series and performing statistical tests for significance of changes in the mean.

4. Mapping Ensemble Spread.ipynb: Extends the treatment of statistical tests from tutorial 3 and applies them to mapped changes in precipitation.
